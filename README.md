##Create a choose your own adventure program

Choose your own adventure (CYAC) was a popular series of books that was published in the mid 1980's.  Instead of reading the book from cover to cover, you would read the contents of a page.  It would have a few options about what you wanted to do next in the story, and the options would direct you to an appropriate page to continue your adventure. Some options would allow you to keep going, while others could lead to death or a happy ending.  

The key to the CYAC books was that a single part of the story (1 page) was kind of a contained section.

We can create our own CYAC using multiple print statements.  First thing you want to do is flesh out your story with a web diagram.  This is best planned on paper.

We can create our own CYAC adventure program, but we will need multiple files to represent each page.  An example has been created for you!

Once you have a plan, you can start filling in contents for your pages.
